**Q22-** The code executes correctly and displays the right info. 

**Q23-** The borrowed code is executing very nicely with a precise and well displayed output. Both methods display correct info but the first one takes a lot of space.

**Q24-** We had a lot of trouble with the Bash file. I finally used the parameters in the configuration menu in pycharm and was able to define the Keys there without needing the Bash file. This was really furstrating and time consuming as I wanted to find the answer by myself. Apart from that, it was a nice lab!
